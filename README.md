# Movie_Recommender_System

This is a Content-based recommendation system which recommends 5 movies based on the option selected. It also contains a sentiment analysis model which predicts sentiments related to the reviews of a movie.

#### Datasets used for Recommendation model: https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv

#### Dataset used for Sentiment analysis : https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-review

I have also done some web-scraping for getting the reviews related to a movie. I have used Flask as my web framework and then deployed it on Heroku.
